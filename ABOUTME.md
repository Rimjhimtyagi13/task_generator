# About Me

Hi, I’m Rimjhim Tyagi 👋  
I’m a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in building practical, user-focused tools using Python, data, and AI.

This project was built as part of a technical assignment to demonstrate my ability to:
- quickly understand product requirements,
- design a simple but usable web application,
- integrate AI responsibly,
- and deliver a hosted, working solution.

## Background

- Education: Computer Science
- Interests: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, AI-powered applications
- Tools I frequently use:
  - Python
  - Streamlit
  - Git & GitHub
  - SQL
  - OpenAI / LLM APIs

I enjoy converting abstract ideas into usable software and focusing on clarity, validation, and user experience.

## About This Project

**Tasks Generator (Mini Planning Tool)** is a web application that helps transform a high-level feature idea into:
- structured user stories,
- engineering tasks,
- and a lightweight planning spec.

The app allows users to:
- input a feature goal, target users, and constraints,
- generate tasks using an LLM (or mock mode),
- edit the generated tasks,
- view the last 5 generated specs,
- and export results for further use.

The project prioritizes:
- simplicity,
- clear UX,
- clean code structure,
- and safe AI usage.

## AI Usage Philosophy

AI is used as a **helper**, not a replacement for reasoning.  
All prompts, outputs, and flows were reviewed manually, and mock outputs are supported to ensure the app works even without an API key.

Details about AI usage are documented separately in:
- `AI_NOTES.md`
- `PROMPTS_USED.md`
